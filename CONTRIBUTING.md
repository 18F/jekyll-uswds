## Development

To develop this theme and/or test it locally:

1. Clone this repo

1. Check the version of USWDS in `package.json` â€” update to the newest version if necessary, and sync its new files to the theme.

   > `rake update`

1. Start Jekyll to preview the effects of your changes. This will build the Jekyll site, watch the Sass files, and recompile the Sass when there are changes.

   > `npm start`

   **or**

   Create a new Jekyll project, follow the
   [installation](#installation) instructions, then change your
   `Gemfile` to point at the local clone of this repo:

   ```ruby
   gem 'uswds-jekyll', :path => '../path/to/uswds-jekyll'
   ```

## Updating the U.S. Web Design System

Run `rake update`

## NPM scripts

- `start`: Starts the jekyll site
- `setup-uswds`: Copies assets from the USWDS package to their theme locations, but running the following scipts, which can also be run separately:
  - `sync-assets`: Copies assets to `assets/uswds`
  - `sync-sass`: Copies Sass cource files to `_sass/uswds/src/`
  - `sync-default-settings`: Copies default settings files to `_sass/uswds/settings`
  - `sync-theme-settings`: Copies only theme settings files to `_sass/settings`

## Releasing a new version

1. Update the gem version in [`uswds-jekyll.gemspec`](uswds-jekyll.gemspec)
1. `bundle install`
1. Add a PR for the update and get it merged
1. `bundle exec rake release` which creates the tag based on the version in the gemspec file and pushes the tag to Github and the gem to RubyGems.
1. Add a GitHub release to the releases page with the same version number
1. You should see the latest version [on RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/uswds-jekyll)
