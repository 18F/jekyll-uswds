The SCINet Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) seeks new members for 3-year terms every February-March. 

The SAC meets monthly to provide input on planning, educational and communications activities of the SCINet initiative. For example, in the past year SAC members have created a quarterly SCINet newsletter, designed a user needs survey, created this new SCINet website, and held multiple computational workshops and trainings.
 
**If you are interested in serving please check this page during the February-March timeframe for access to an application (short paragraph description of your interest and background).**
