We have unique opportunities available for postdocs to gain experience working on big data problems in agriculture while learning new skills, such as machine learning, data mining, and conducting research in a high performance computing environment. These 2-year SCINet-funded positions will be based at various ARS locations across the US under the direction of ARS scientists. Each position will be administered by the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE).<br><br>
