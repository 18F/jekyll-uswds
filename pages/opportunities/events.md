The SCINet initiative would like to conduct a series of training workshops on artificial intelligence (AI) in FY20.

We envision workshops covering new, intermediate, and experienced AI users, i.e. introductory through advanced modules in subjects such as machine learning, deep learning, neural nets, big data manipulation, etc. based upon your feedback and requirements. This will also be an opportunity to communicate the limitations you have encountered in moving your AI research forward.

ARS Acting Chief Science Information Officer, Deb Peters, will coordinate development of the training workshops.


***Interested staff should notify Deb Peters by January 24 and <br>indicate subjects(s) and level(s) of AI training of interest.***
