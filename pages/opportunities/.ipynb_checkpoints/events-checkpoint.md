The SCINet initiative is planning to host a number of virtual training/workshop events in the coming months for USDA ARS scientists and collaborators. Information on how to attend these events will be posted on this page closer to the event date. You need not have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the workshop. All trainings will take place online (see also [https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/]). Once registered, you will be provided with connection information, and instructions for software installations. All software used is open source, so you must have administrative privileges on your machine.
