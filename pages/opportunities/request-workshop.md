## Proposals for Self-led SCINet-funded Workshops or Training 

### [Request for FY20 SCINet Workshop/Training Application](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SCINet) (Due Feb 1, 2020)

The SCINet initiative is currently accepting proposals for FY 2020 trainings and workshops. These events can span a broad range of activities from establishing/promoting SCINet-related computational working groups to conducting local or national computational trainings. Successful proposals must state how state how the workshop/training will promote the goals of SCINet, including: 
- improving high performance computing or big data analytical capabilities of ARS scientists
- increasing use of SCINet resources (e.g., Ceres, cloud computing) by ARS scientists or disciplines that are under-represented on SCINet
- improving access to ARS data. 

At your request, members of the SCINet Virtual Research Support Core (VRSC) can be available remotely or in-person to support your event. As part of the application, we ask that you consider aspects such as the number of attendees, the experience level required to participate, the type of travel authorization that will be required, if the event will be internal to USDA ARS or open to outside collaborators, and a cost estimate. 

If you would like to hold a SCINet-funded workshop or training in FY20, please submit this application by Feb 1, 2020 for full consideration. Submissions after this date will be contingent upon the availability of funds. Workshop or training dates proposed for May 4, 2020 or earlier may be given higher priority. Your request will be reviewed by the SCINet Advisory Committee and the ARS Chief Science Information Officer. Questions about the application can be sent to deb.peters@usda.gov.
