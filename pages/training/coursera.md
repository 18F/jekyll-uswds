The SCINet Initiative and the AI Center of Excellence are excited to provide a training opportunity through [Coursera](coursera.org). This program will provide a limited number of Coursera licenses free to ARS scientists and support staff to complete courses and specializations focused on scientific computing and artificial intelligence. Successful completion of courses and specializations will result in **widely recognized certificates and credentials**. Note that you should expect to spend 2-3 hours per week on many of these classes, especially for the more advanced courses.

## Programs of Study

The ARS-Coursera portal includes Programs of Study related to scientific computing and artificial intelligence from top-tier institutions. The ARS Programs of Study are actively growing catalogues, and Coursera continues to add classes on a regular basis. ARS employees are *encouraged to request additional courses/specializations* to be added to our portal by sending an email to scinet-training@usda.gov.

**SCINet**: The courses and specializations focus on general computational and data-science skills (course catalogue at: https://www.coursera.org/programs/scinet-program-of-study-a6nd3).

**AI Center of Excellence**: Content in the courses and specializations are varied, ranging from high-level introductory to technical classical machine learning and deep-learning (course catalogue at: https://www.coursera.org/programs/ai-center-of-excellence-program-of-study-yunri).

## Application Process

The application for licenses is on a quarterly basis. *Applicants need to have their supervisors submit their application forms*. The application form can be downloaded at [**this link**](/assets/forms/coursera_form.xlsx). Complete the application form and have your *supervisor* send it to scinet-training@usda.gov. You will be sent a Coursera welcome email on/near the license allocation date (see below table). For active learners, we will make an effort to extend licenses across quarters. The application deadline and license allocation periods are:
