# How to Access Training on Different Platforms
### AgLearn 

All federal USDA permanent and term employees should be able to access the AgLearn courses listed on this page by following the posted links.

Non-federal USDA employees (contractors) do not have access to many of the courses in AgLearn, despite being able to login to AgLearn with their PIV card/eAuthentication. An exception is AgLearn/LinkedIn Learning courses. Non-federal USDA employees may be able to access AgLearn/LinkedIn Learning using the following steps:
1.  Go to aglearn.usda.gov but DO NOT LOG IN
2.  In the "Welcome to AgLearn" pane, click on LinkedIn Learning
3.  Follow the instructions to "access your LinkedIn Learning account directly" by following the link and logging in with your eAuthentication credentials. (Do not log in to AgLearn)
4.  Find any of the AgLearn/LinkedIn trainings listed on this page by typing the title of the course in the LinkedIn Learning search bar.

Please contact your Agency [AgLearn Point of Contact](https://usda.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1705/) with questions about access to AgLearn courses.

### Coursera.org

Many Coursera courses can be audited for free (i.e. no certification which requires a fee). See https://www.classcentral.com/report/coursera-signup-for-free/ for instructions on how to sign up to audit a Coursera course (for free and without activating the 7-day trial period). Pay special attention how to access courses for free within a specialization and also to pre-requisites for advanced topics.

**SCINet-funded licenses for Coursera course certificates:** The SCINet initiative is in the process of purchasing licenses for ARS Scientists to obtain course certificates for completed Coursera and/or EdX courses. If interested in certification for courses, you may want to wait until you are able to obtain one of these licenses. More information will be posted here as soon as it is available. 
 
### sas.com and jmp.com
While links below to SAS and JMP videos are immediately accessible, SAS and JMP course offerings on sas.com and jmp.com (not the courses offered through AgLearn) require the learner to create a free account with their email address and password.
