### High Performance Computing
- The [Bioinformatics Workbook](https://bioinformaticsworkbook.org/) created by Andrew Severin and colleagues at Iowa State University has guides and tutorials extending well beyond the bioinformatics community. Researchers of all backgrounds can use the workbook for UNIX command line basics, HPC info, project management tips, and data visualization tutorials. For bioinformatics researchers there is also information on experimental design, genome assembly and annotation, RNA sequencing, variant discovery, and more.

- Checkout the [Iowa State High-Performance Computing website](https://www.hpc.iastate.edu/guides) for more guides on compute clusters, UNIX command line, building containers, and data transfer with Globus.

### Data Management
- [Data Management Skillbuilding Hub](https://dataoneorg.github.io/Education/), a searchable repository of data management lessons, best practices and videos maintained by DataONE

- [Data Management Plan Guidance](https://www.nal.usda.gov/main/data/data-management-plan-guidance) from the National Agricultural Library on how to write a data management plan for your research data

### Machine Learning Tutorials

- Tutorials on machine learning and visualization in Python for Earth science (a collaboration between NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Anaconda) [https://earthml.holoviz.org/index.html](https://earthml.holoviz.org/index.html)

- Machine learning tutorials using Python aimed at life sciences from the FY19 USDA ARS/University of Florida Machine Learning Training [https://usda-ars-gbru.github.io/ml-training-site/](https://usda-ars-gbru.github.io/ml-training-site/)
