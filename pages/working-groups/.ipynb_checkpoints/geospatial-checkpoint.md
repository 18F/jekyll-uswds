This working group was formed as the result of a September 2019 SCINet-funded workshop hosted by Deb Peters, the acting ARS Chief Science Information Officer. The focus of the group is to provide continued input on the development of SCINet, to determine the computational needs of ARS geospatial researchers, and to develop collaborative research projects. The group will also learn from each other on topics related to high-performance computing. For example, how to use Ceres (the ARS high-performance computer), optimizing code for parallel processing, getting software onto Ceres, etc. Monthly working group teleconference calls and working sessions are beginning soon. 

If you would like to join the group, please contact Kerrie Geil to be added to the groupâ€™s Basecamp.

## Workshops

#### 2020 Meeting of the SCINet Geospatial Research Working Group

The working group has an upcoming workshop to be held remotely as multiple sessions on Zoom from 11am - 2pm Mountain time on August 25, 27, 28, and September 1. Participation in all sessions not required; participants can pick and choose which sessions to attend based on their interest and experience. Link to the workshop website with more information coming soon.

Topics to be covered will include: 

- a recap from the 2019 workshop, 
- progress on the Ceres geospatial common data library, 
- progress on the geospatial workbook computing tutorials, 
- hands-on tutorial training: 
    - how to access the Ceres HPC, use JupyterHub (and RStudio) on the Ceres HPC, linux basics 
    - introduction to distributed computing on the Ceres HPC (Python)
    - approaches for reproducible research computing (containers, Python environments, workflow tools)
    - distributed Machine Learning using Xgboost with NDVI, soil, and climate data (Python)
- speaker day with panel session: "Challenges and opportunities in leveraging machine learning techniques to further sustainable and intensified agriculture"

There will also be a premeeting session on August 19 from 11am-1pm Mountain time to ensure participants have a functioning SCINet/Ceres account to enable participation in the hands-on tutorial sessions.

**Please contact Kerrie Geil and Rowan Gaffney if you would like information on how to participate. Non-members are welcome!**



#### September 2019: Artificial Intelligence and the Accessibility and Analysis of Geospatial Data: A SCINet Workshop

A group of over 36 geospatial scientists, post-docs, research leaders, and data managers gathered at the ARS Jornada Rangeland Research Unit in Las Cruces, NM on September 10-11, 2019 to discuss high-performance computing (HPC) issues and artificial intelligence research methods applied to geospatial problems. The group identified computational issues with accessing and using SCINet and the ARS HPC system for geospatial research and also gained exposure to relevant machine learning and deep learning research methods. The workshop resulted in the creation of a SCINet Geospatial Research Working Group to continue identifying and addressing complex computational problems as well as to collaborate on new geospatial research projects.
