This working group was formed as the result of a September 2019 SCINet-funded workshop hosted by Deb Peters, the acting ARS Chief Science Information Officer. The focus of the group is to provide continued input on the development of SCINet, to determine the computational needs of ARS geospatial researchers, and to develop collaborative research projects. The group will also learn from each other on topics related to high-performance computing. For example, how to use Ceres (the ARS high-performance computer), optimizing code for parallel processing, getting software onto Ceres, etc. Monthly working group teleconference calls and working sessions are beginning soon. 

If you would like to join the group, please contact Kerrie Geil to be added to the groupâ€™s Basecamp.

## Workshops

### Upcoming: SCINet Geospatial Workshop 2020

**Aug 25 - Sep 1, 2020  &middot;   remotely on Zoom   &middot;   lead: Kerrie Geil, Rowan Gaffney**

The working group will hold their annual workshop over 6 separate sessions on Zoom. 

Participation in all sessions is not required. We hope everyone will join Session 1: Annual Meeting of the Working Group (non-members welcome) and then pick and choose which other sessions to attend based on interest and computational skill level. 

Much of this year's workshop will be interactive follow-along tutorials for which participants will need to already have or [apply for a SCINet account](/signup/). If you need to apply for an account we recommend you do so no later than 8/12/2020 as the account approval process can take 1-2 weeks and then there are a couple additional steps to take before you can successfully access your account (instructions provided upon account approval). Attend Session 0 of the workshop if you are having trouble accessing your account.

**Visit the [workshop website](https://kerriegeil.github.io/SCINET-GEOSPATIAL-RESEARCH-WG/) to register for each session you plan to attend.**

### September 2019: Artificial Intelligence and the Accessibility and Analysis of Geospatial Data: A SCINet Workshop

**09/10/2019 - 09/11/2019   &middot;   Las Cruces, NM   &middot;   lead: Deb Peters**

A group of over 36 geospatial scientists, post-docs, research leaders, and data managers gathered at the ARS Jornada Rangeland Research Unit in Las Cruces, NM on September 10-11, 2019 to discuss high-performance computing (HPC) issues and artificial intelligence research methods applied to geospatial problems. The group identified computational issues with accessing and using SCINet and the ARS HPC system for geospatial research and also gained exposure to relevant machine learning and deep learning research methods. The workshop resulted in the creation of a SCINet Geospatial Research Working Group to continue identifying and addressing complex computational problems as well as to collaborate on new geospatial research projects.
