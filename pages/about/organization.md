The Scinet program is led by the Associate administrator for National Programs, Dr. Steven Kappes,
the Associate administrator for Research Management and Operations, Dr Simon Liu
 and the Acting Chief Scientific information officer Dr. Debra Peters. The
program is guided by an Executive Director and an Executive Committee with
input from a Scientific Advisory Committee.

The program runs three high performance computer clusters.  The Ceres cluster
is housed at the National Animal disease center in Ames. IA and operated by
Iowa State University. A Cray cluster is located and run by Mississippi State
University in Starkville, MS and a planned cluster will be housed and operated
at the National Agricultural Library in Beltsville, MD.

User support at SCINet is provided by the  Virtual Support Research Core (VSRC)
operated by Iowas State University.
