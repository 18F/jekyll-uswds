The Scinet program is led by the Associate administrator for National Programs, Dr. Steven Kappes,
the Associate administrator for Research Management and Operations, Dr Simon Liu
 and the Acting Chief Scientific information officer Dr. Debra Peters. The
program is guided by an Executive Director and an Executive Committee with
input from a Scientific Advisory Committee.

The program runs three high performance computer clusters.  The Ceres cluster
is housed at the National Animal disease center in Ames. IA and operated by
Iowa State University. A Cray cluster is located and run by Mississippi State
University in Starkville, MS and a planned cluster will be housed and operated
at the National Agricultural Library in Beltsville, MD.

User support at SCINet is provided by the  Virtual Support Research Core (VSRC)
operated by Iowas State University.

WAITING FOR A FEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SCINET PROGRAM TO OCCUR, THEN NEED TO EDIT THE TEXT BELOW AND REPLACE THE INFORMATION ON THIS PAGE ENTIRELY
# Executive Committee
The ARS Scientific Computing Initiative is led by an Executive Committee comprised of ARS leadership including Dr. Steven Kappes – Associate Administrator for National Programs, Dr. Simon Liu – Associate Administrator for Research Management and Operations, Dr. Debra Peters – Acting Chief Scientific Information Officer, and Stan Kosecki – Acting SCINet Program Manager. The Executive Committee is guided by security professionals, system administrators, a team of computational ARS scientists called the Scientific Advisory Committee, an HPC Policy Standing Committee, and an HPC Software Standing Committee.
#Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC)
The ARS Scientific Computing Initiative is in the dominion of ARS researchers, thus the program is in a constant state of gathering and meeting their research needs. The SAC is an effort to assure that happens.  SAC members represent a broad breadth of scientific research at ARS and membership includes two researchers from each of the five ARS geographic areas, a statistician member, and an “at-large” member. The SAC divides its work over various subcommittees: communications, education, planning, software and membership. In recent years, the SAC has created a quarterly SCINet newsletter, designed a user needs survey, created the scinet.usda.gov website, and held multiple computational workshops and trainings. SAC progress and issues are elevated to the Executive Committee for review and approval. For more information, including how to participate (non-members welcome), please contact Adam Rivers (chair).

#HPC Policy Standing Committee
Formed in 2020, this committee makes recommendations to the Executive Committee on policies and procedures that are relevant to HPC operations. The committee is comprised of members from various technical backgrounds and includes representation from different ARS geographic areas. Membership also includes representatives from Iowa State University and Mississippi State University (where two of the ARS HPC systems are housed) in order to get proper representation and perspective of the issues that need to be addressed. Policy Committee progress and issues are elevated to the Executive Committee for review and approval. For more information, including how to participate, please contact Jonathan Shao (chair).

#Scientific Points of Contact (SPOCs)
Each ARS location also has at least one designated point of contact for the ARS Scientific Computing Initiative. These representatives are occasionally contacted by the various committees when information from many locations is required for decision making. For more information, including how to participate, please contact Stan Kosecki.
