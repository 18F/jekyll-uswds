## Getting started material for authors.
(please remove after writing the article)

* For examples of formatting in markdown see [this page](/theme/)
* To add photos
  1. place them in the `/assets/img/` directory
  2. place them on the page using this tag:

  ```markdown
  ![](/assets/img/example_pic.jpg)
  ```

## Page specific instructions

* We need a listing of software available with the module system. If we could
tag applications with a few product areas that would help.  

This list should be generated as a `CSV` file placed in the `_data` directory
I will integrate it as a datatables plugin.
