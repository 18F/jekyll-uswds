# Why should I use Jupyter?

## Background

This guide aims to answer the basic question of why you should use Jupyter for your scientific computing.

### What is Jupyter?

In a nutshell, Jupyter is a tool that allows you to interactively run and visualize the results of your code in a "notebook" like format, just like a digital version of the written lab notebooks you might keep.

### What can it be used for?

For example, you might be interested in plotting some climate data across a few years in a given region.  Jupyter will allow you to import your data, filter and transform the data, run some stats analyses on it, and plot your results all in one place. 

## Why Jupyter?

### It's easy to use

Jupyter is a lab notebook, a version control system, a development environment, and a visualization tool all in one.  This makes it a one-stop shop for all your scientific computing needs. It works in your browser, so there's no need to install confusing software packages on your machine. It has a simple and easy user interface.
