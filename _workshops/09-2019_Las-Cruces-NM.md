A group of over 36 geospatial scientists, post-docs, research leaders, and data managers gathered at the ARS Jornada Rangeland Research Unit in Las Cruces, NM in September 2019 to discuss high-performance computing (HPC) issues and artificial intelligence research methods applied to geospatial problems. The group identified computational issues with accessing and using SCINet and the ARS HPC system for geospatial research and also gained exposure to relevant machine learning and deep learning research methods. The workshop resulted in the creation of a SCINet Geospatial Working Group to continue identifying and addressing complex computational problems as well as to collaborate on new geospatial research projects. Recordings of the presentations and other conference materials can be found on SCINet-funded Workshops Basecamp, contact kerrie.geil@usda.gov for access to the Basecamp project or to get involved with the Working Group.
